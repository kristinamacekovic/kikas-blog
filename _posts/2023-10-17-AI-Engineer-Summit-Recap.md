I was fortunate to attend the inaugural AI Engineer Summit conference. It was a great experience, not only because it was my first time in the US, but specifically because the conference content was so packed with value. I especially liked the Sunday pre-conference workshop whose aim was to prep attendees for topics they will encounter at the conference. This was really useful, especially for a niche that’s evolving this fast.

Now that the dust has settled, I took some time to aggregate all the materials that have been shared so far, as well as some that I collected during the talks and workshops. Hopefully it will serve everyone who didn’t make it to the conference in-person or remote, or anyone wanting to learn about the space. Not everything is available here as I couldn’t attend all workshops and not all slides have been shared; I’ll try to update as other material is shared.
